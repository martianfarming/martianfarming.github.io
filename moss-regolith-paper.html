resource utilization (ISRU) is by far the cheapest way of supporting
a future human colony on Mars. Research by teams in the Netherlands
and elsewhere demonstrating the feasibility of growing a variety of
plant species in Martian regolith simulant have shown encouraging
results, albeit with limited success. Problems have included slow
growth and low yield. Martian regolith characteristically lacks any
organic matter and thus is naturally devoid of its essential
by-product: bio-available nitrogen. Martian regolith also drains
poorly, retaining moisture heavily. These problems could be remedied
by the addition of dried moss to Martian regolith simulant as a soil
amendment. Moss &ldquo;slurry&rdquo; can be used to sporulate Martian
regolith simulant, and will germinate and thrive without the addition
of anything but water. This is because moss, as well as other
bryophytes, do not have true roots but instead create string-like
rhizoids which serve only to anchor them to their substrates. Mosses
do not absorb water or nutrients through their rhizoids, they do so
atmospherically. Furthermore, interplanetary shipments of moss spores
represents an exponentially more lightweight and cheaper alternative
to shipping seed, embryonic plant material and other previously
explored options to Mars.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Liberation Sans, Arial, serif">The
question of how can agriculture support a future human colony on Mars
is an emerging field of science. There have been numerous general
proposals and conceptual frameworks regarding how to approach growing
food and construction materials on location. One of the main problems
researchers immediately noticed about Martian regolith simulant was
the lack of bio-available nitrogen. Experiments conducted in the
Netherlands demonstrated nevertheless green manure and food
production are feasible. My goal was to find a simple, yet effective
method of improving the quality of Martian regolith simulant. Moss
cultivation has been used by humans for hundreds, if not thousands of
years. The question was then drawn: can moss be grown in Martian
regolith simulant? Initial research suggested it could be done and
pointed to many advantages.</FONT></P>

JSC-Mars-1A regolith simulant was purchased from a US-based NASA
contractor. The regolith simulant was manufactured by NASA for the
purpose of materials experiments and in-situ resource processing
research. It has previously been shown to contain a surprising amount
of plant-available nutrients and a relatively high soil pH of 7.3.
The toxicity of the heavy metals contained within plants grown in the
regolith is as of yet undetermined [1].</FONT></P>

moss was collected directly from the outdoors in the southeastern
United States, a humid subtropical climate, in early winter. Red clay
is prevalent in the area and moss is commonly found thriving on it.
Samples were collected from clay found with a soil pH of
approximately pH 8.5. Samples were then gently pureed with distilled
water (pH 5.5, ppm 0007) and afterwards the solution poured on top of
the Martian regolith. There ended up being at least three distinct
species of moss. Two were identified as Thuidium delicataulum and
Dicranum scoparium.</FONT></P>

experiment was started on the evening of January 11<SUP>th</SUP>,
2016. Fledgling growth was observed within 18 days. The first and
only watering (pH 5.5, ppm 0012) occurred on day 14. Watering beyond
this point was determined to have been in excess and was therefore
stopped. Samples were thriving by day 23. On day 36, the tallest
length of moss was measured at 8 cm. Some die-back of old growth was
also observed at this point. The experiment was terminated on day 60.
From the original 30.24 g of Martian regolith simulant, the
experiment yielded 47.36 g of moss. As of June 7<SUP>th</SUP>, 2016,
the samples are still alive and well, with multiple layers of dead
growth and new moss now formed on top.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 200%"><FONT FACE="Liberation Sans, Arial, serif">Given
that the experiment was restricted by the use of simulant and
environmental conditions, it is at least highly feasible that moss
could be cultivated indoors on a prospective Martian colony for use
as a soil amendment. It can be said to thrive in JSC-Mars-1A regolith
simulant. Among some of the appealing benefits are its low
maintenance qualities. The sample was never fed any nutrient solution
and only watered a single time. Total amount of energy used over a
60-day period was only 18.72 kWh.</FONT></P>

experimentation must be carried out determine the feasibility of
cultivating moss on Mars itself, in and around fluvial plains,
mimicking the temperature, moisture and low-gravity of the Martian
frontier. Experiments are also needed to determine the efficacy of
regolith-grown moss as a nitrifying and pH-reducing soil amendment.</FONT></P>
